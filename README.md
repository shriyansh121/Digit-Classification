# Digit-Classification
This repository consist of image processing code of digit classification. Here two approach is used first is using simple Dense layer and second one is Lenet. 

# LeNet Architecture

LeNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that was developed by Yann LeCun and his colleagues in 1989. This architecture played a crucial role in demonstrating the potential of neural networks for image recognition tasks, especially in reading handwritten digits and characters. LeNet is considered one of the earliest examples of CNNs, which are now foundational to many modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications in image and video analysis. 

## 
The structure of LeNet consists of multiple layers designed to automatically and efficiently recognize patterns in images. The network typically includes two sets of convolutional and pooling (sub-sampling) layers followed by fully connected layers. Convolutional layers apply various filters to the input images to create feature maps that summarize key features such as edges and shapes. Pooling layers then reduce the dimensions of these feature maps to make the processing more manageable and to help the network focus on the most important features. Finally, the fully connected layers compute the final classifications, such as identifying which digit is present in an image.
